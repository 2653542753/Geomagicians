We have the following output convention:

For in-triangle test, 
we output 0 for points exactly located on triangle.
output -1 for points located outside the triangle.
output 1 for points located inside the triangle.

For in-circle test,
we output 0 for points exactly located on circle.
output -1 for points located outside the circle.
output 1 for points located inside the triangle.
Especially, for the degenerate case, which means three input points forming a straight line, we output 0 instead of 1 given by the standard output.
